# Virtual-Pen

Computer Vision Project : Virtual Pen using OpenCV and Python

Draw on Canvas just by using your Web-Camera and moving a Sketch Pen in the air in front of the camera. It automatically detects the color of the Sketch Pen you are using and starts drawing as you move your hand. Keep the pen's cap on and cap's tip facing straight towards the Camera.

Adjust the Threshold values of the colors for better results as the sketch pen color you are using maybe a little different from the ones I used while making this Project. Only designed for Green, Purple, and Yellow color pens. Make sure that cap of sketch pen is of same color as the ink.
